**Subject:** Request for Removal of Non-Compliant and/or Inaccurate Derogatory Accounts  

Dear [Credit Bureau Name] Dispute Department,  

I am writing to formally dispute non-compliant, inaccurate, and/or unverifiable derogatory information on my credit report. This information is negatively impacting my credit score, and I am requesting an immediate investigation and correction pursuant to the **Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA)**.  

## Inaccurate/Unverifiable/Non-Compliant Accounts:

| Account Name    | Account Number    | Reason for Dispute    |
|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------------|
| [Creditor Name 1] | [Account Number 1] | [Reason: e.g., FCRA or Metro-2 violations or Errors account not mine, incorrect balance, etc.] |
| [Creditor Name 2] | [Account Number 2] | [Reason: e.g., FCRA or Metro-2 violations or Errors account not mine, incorrect balance, duplicate account, inaccurate status, etc.] |

## Specific Errors:

1. **Account Name:** [Creditor Name 1]  
   - **Error(s):** [E.g., incorrect balance, incorrect status as "charge-off," account not mine, etc.]  
   - **Supporting Evidence:** [E.g., proof of payments, account closure letter, etc.]  

2. **Account Name:** [Creditor Name 2]  
   - **Error(s):** [E.g., account reported twice, wrong date of last activity, etc.]  
   - **Supporting Evidence:** [E.g., documentation from the creditor, dispute history, etc.]  

## Requested Action:

1. **Removal of Inaccurate/Unverifiable Information:** Remove all derogatory accounts that cannot be verified as accurate and complete within the timeframes outlined by the FCRA.  
2. **Correction of Errors:** Ensure any inaccuracies in account status, balances, or payment history are corrected immediately.  
3. **Notification of Updates:** Notify me in writing once the investigation has been completed and confirm whether the disputed information has been removed or updated.  

## Legal Basis for Dispute(s):

Under **FCRA Section 611 (15 U.S.C. ยง 1681i)**, credit reporting agencies must ensure that all information reported is accurate, complete, and verifiable. Additionally:  

- The **Metro-2 Reporting Standards** require compliance with accurate reporting of account balances, statuses, and activity.  
- Under **15 U.S.C. ยง 1692e** of the FDCPA, debt collectors are prohibited from reporting false or misleading information.  
- Any unverifiable or inaccurate account information must be deleted under **FCRA Section 623 (15 U.S.C. ยง 1681s-2)**.  

I expect this matter to be resolved within the 30-day period required by law.  

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.  

Sincerely,  
[Your Full Name]
