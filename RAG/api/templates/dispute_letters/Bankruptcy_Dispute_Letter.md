**Subject:** Dispute of Inaccurate Bankruptcy Reporting  

Dear [Credit Bureau Name] Dispute Department,  

I am writing to formally dispute the inaccurate and/or unverifiable bankruptcy information listed on my credit report. Pursuant to the **Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA)** and **Metro-2 Reporting Standards**, I am requesting an immediate investigation to ensure that only accurate, complete, and verifiable information is reported.  

## Inaccurate Bankruptcy Information:

| Court Name or Creditor | Case/Account Number | Filing/Reporting Date | Reason for Dispute |
|------------------------|---------------------|------------------------|--------------------|
| [Bankruptcy Court Name] | [Case Number]       | [Filing Date]          | [Reason: e.g., not my bankruptcy, incorrect filing date, etc.] |

## Specific Errors:

1. **Case Information:**  
   - Error(s): [E.g., incorrect court name, case number mismatch, improper status as "open," incorrect filing or discharge date.]  
   - Supporting Evidence: [E.g., court documents showing case resolution or absence of filing, etc.]  

2. **Public Record Reporting:**  
   - Error(s): [E.g., record not verified with the appropriate court, incorrect inclusion in report after removal.]  
   - Supporting Evidence: [E.g., statement or response from the court or other public record sources.]  

## Requested Action:

1. **Verify Information:** Verify with the appropriate court that the reported bankruptcy information is accurate, complete, and up-to-date.  
2. **Remove Inaccurate Data:** Remove the bankruptcy information if it cannot be verified as accurate and complete.  
3. **Notification of Updates:** Notify me in writing once the investigation is complete and confirm the actions taken regarding the disputed information.  

## Legal Basis for Dispute:

Under **FCRA Section 611 (15 U.S.C. ยง 1681i)**, credit reporting agencies are required to investigate disputes and verify the accuracy of the reported information. Additionally:  

- **FCRA Section 609 (15 U.S.C. ยง 1681g)** provides me with the right to request how this bankruptcy was verified.  
- **Metro-2 Reporting Standards** dictate accurate and timely reporting of bankruptcy status and details.  
- Inaccurate or unverifiable public record information violates **FCRA Section 623 (15 U.S.C. ยง 1681s-2)**.  

## Supporting Documents:

I have enclosed the following documents to assist in your investigation:  

1. Copy of my government-issued ID.  
2. Copy of my credit report with the disputed bankruptcy information highlighted.  
3. Court records and/or other supporting evidence showing inaccuracies in the reporting.  

## Additional Notes:

This information must be verified directly with the court and not with third-party vendors. If this information cannot be verified as accurate and complete, it must be removed under **FCRA Section 611(a)(5)(A)**.  

I expect a resolution to this matter within the 30-day period as required by law.  

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.  

Sincerely,  
[Your Full Name]
