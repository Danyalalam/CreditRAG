    <h2>Subject: Dispute of Inaccurate Bankruptcy Reporting</h2>

    <p>Dear [Credit Bureau Name] Dispute Department,</p>

    <p>I am writing to formally dispute the inaccurate and/or unverifiable bankruptcy information listed on my credit report. Pursuant to the <strong>Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA)</strong> and <strong>Metro-2 Reporting Standards</strong>, I am requesting an immediate investigation to ensure that only accurate, complete, and verifiable information is reported.</p>

    <h2>Inaccurate Bankruptcy Information:</h2>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Court Name or Creditor</th>
            <th>Case/Account Number</th>
            <th>Filing/Reporting Date</th>
            <th>Reason for Dispute</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>[Bankruptcy Court Name]</td>
            <td>[Case Number]</td>
            <td>[Filing Date]</td>
            <td>[Reason: e.g., not my bankruptcy, incorrect filing date, etc.]</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h2>Specific Errors:</h2>

    <h3>1. Case Information:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Error(s):</strong> [E.g., incorrect court name, case number mismatch, improper status as "open," incorrect filing or discharge date.]</li>
        <li><strong>Supporting Evidence:</strong> [E.g., court documents showing case resolution or absence of filing, etc.]</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Public Record Reporting:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Error(s):</strong> [E.g., record not verified with the appropriate court, incorrect inclusion in report after removal.]</li>
        <li><strong>Supporting Evidence:</strong> [E.g., statement or response from the court or other public record sources.]</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Requested Action:</h2>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Verify Information:</strong> Verify with the appropriate court that the reported bankruptcy information is accurate, complete, and up-to-date.</li>
        <li><strong>Remove Inaccurate Data:</strong> Remove the bankruptcy information if it cannot be verified as accurate and complete.</li>
        <li><strong>Notification of Updates:</strong> Notify me in writing once the investigation is complete and confirm the actions taken regarding the disputed information.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Legal Basis for Dispute:</h2>

    <p>Under <strong>FCRA Section 611 (15 U.S.C. ยง 1681i)</strong>, credit reporting agencies are required to investigate disputes and verify the accuracy of the reported information. Additionally:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>FCRA Section 609 (15 U.S.C. ยง 1681g)</strong> provides me with the right to request how this bankruptcy was verified.</li>
        <li><strong>Metro-2 Reporting Standards</strong> dictate accurate and timely reporting of bankruptcy status and details.</li>
        <li>Inaccurate or unverifiable public record information violates <strong>FCRA Section 623 (15 U.S.C. ยง 1681s-2)</strong>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Supporting Documents:</h2>

    <p>I have enclosed the following documents to assist in your investigation:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Copy of my government-issued ID.</li>
        <li>Copy of my credit report with the disputed bankruptcy information highlighted.</li>
        <li>Court records and/or other supporting evidence showing inaccuracies in the reporting.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Additional Notes:</h2>

    <p>This information must be verified directly with the court and not with third-party vendors. If this information cannot be verified as accurate and complete, it must be removed under <strong>FCRA Section 611(a)(5)(A)</strong>.</p>

    <p>I expect a resolution to this matter within the 30-day period as required by law.</p>

    <p>Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.</p>

    <p>Sincerely,</p>

    <p><strong>[Your Full Name]</strong></p>
