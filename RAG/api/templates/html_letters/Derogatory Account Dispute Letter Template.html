    <h2>Subject: Request for Removal of Non-Compliant and/or Inaccurate Derogatory Accounts</h2>

    <p>Dear [Credit Bureau Name] Dispute Department,</p>

    <p>I am writing to formally dispute non-compliant, inaccurate, and/or unverifiable derogatory information on my credit report. This information is negatively impacting my credit score, and I am requesting an immediate investigation and correction pursuant to the <strong>Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA)</strong>.</p>

    <h3>Inaccurate/Unverifiable/Non-Compliant Accounts:</h3>

            <th>Reason for Dispute</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>[Creditor Name 1]</td>
            <td>[Account Number 1]</td>
            <td>[Reason: e.g., FCRA or Metro-2 violations, account not mine, incorrect balance, etc.]</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>[Creditor Name 2]</td>
            <td>[Account Number 2]</td>
            <td>[Reason: e.g., duplicate account, inaccurate status, incorrect balance, etc.]</td>
        </tr>

        <li>The <strong>Metro-2 Reporting Standards</strong> require compliance with accurate reporting of account balances, statuses, and activity.</li>
        <li>Under <strong>15 U.S.C. ยง 1692e</strong> of the FDCPA, debt collectors are prohibited from reporting false or misleading information.</li>
        <li>Any unverifiable or inaccurate account information must be deleted under <strong>FCRA Section 623 (15 U.S.C. ยง 1681s-2)</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
