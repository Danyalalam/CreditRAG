    <h2>Subject: Dispute of Inaccurate Late Payment Information</h2>

    <p>Dear [Credit Bureau Name] Dispute Department,</p>

    <p>I am writing to formally dispute inaccurate late payment information that is currently being reported on my credit report. After reviewing my credit report, I discovered late payment records for the account(s) listed below that are either incorrect, unverifiable, or do not comply with legal reporting standards.</p>

    <h3>Details of the Disputed Account(s):</h3>
    <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">
        <tr>
            <th>Creditor Name</th>
            <th>Account Number</th>
            <th>Reported Late Payment Date(s)</th>
            <th>Reason for Dispute</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>[Creditor Name 1]</td>
            <td>[Account Number 1]</td>
            <td>[Date(s) of Reported Late Payment]</td>
            <td>[Reason: e.g., FCRA or Metro-2 violations, incorrect balance, etc.]</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>[Creditor Name 2]</td>
            <td>[Account Number 2]</td>
            <td>[Date(s) of Reported Late Payment]</td>
            <td>[Reason: e.g., duplicate account, inaccurate status, etc.]</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h3>Background:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Reason 1:</strong> Example: Payment was made on time, as shown by the attached bank statements.</li>
        <li><strong>Reason 2:</strong> Example: This account was paid in full before the due date.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Under the <strong>Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) Section 611 (15 U.S.C. ยง 1681i)</strong>, I have the right to dispute inaccurate information on my credit report. Additionally, furnishers of information are obligated under <strong>FCRA Section 623 (15 U.S.C. ยง 1681s-2)</strong> to ensure the information they report to credit bureaus is accurate and complete.</p>

    <h3>Requested Action:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Investigate the disputed late payment information.</li>
        <li>Provide proof of verification from the original creditor or furnisher of information.</li>
        <li>Remove any late payment information that cannot be verified or is found to be inaccurate.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Notice of Non-Compliance:</h3>
    <p>If the disputed information cannot be verified within the required 30-day period, I request that the inaccurate information be promptly removed, as mandated by <strong>FCRA Section 611(a)(5)(A)</strong>.</p>

    <p>I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter and look forward to receiving confirmation of the corrections made to my credit report.</p>

    <p>Sincerely,</p>
    <p><strong>[Your Full Name]</strong></p>
